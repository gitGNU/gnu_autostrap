# Run the command as root using UML.
# Similar to sudo, but in user mode.
# e.g.: useful to loop-mount disk images w/o root access

# Note: currently (UML 2.6.26) this script is mercilessly killed when
# UML quits, so all the clean-up phase is skipped.  Maybe a signal
# from the internal UML bash process is forwarded to this (external)
# bash process.

# Note: your environment&mounts are _not_ saved between successive
# invokations. We might do that by saving /proc/mounts before killing
# UML, or by letting an initial UML run in background, connected via a
# Unix socket or SSH to accept and execute successive commands (+
# might be more efficient).

# DON'T RUN AS ROOT - it will among others mess with your /etc/mtab

# Dependencies: slirp (fullbolt version), xterm, /dev/console

UML=linux.uml # in /usr/bin

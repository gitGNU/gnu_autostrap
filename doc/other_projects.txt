* vmbuilder: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/JeOSVMBuilder ,
  Debian-based, apparently targetted at generating VMs for existing
  virtualization infrastructures (though it's said to support
  VirtualBox); definitely needs a better look.

* Marionnet: http://www.marionnet.org/ manages lots of UML VMs for
  (say) network simulations, and has an option to build new ones,
  though I don't know how that's implemented.

* qemu-make-debian-root, part of the 'qemu' or 'qemu-utils' package
  under Debian

* rootstrap: also uses UML to build Debian-based systems

* qemubuilder: pbuilder runs qemu - it has to run, control and stop
  qemu, which is something we may need to do (e.g. generating a kernel
  initrd from within the emulator).

* qemu-debootstrap from the 'qemu-kvm' package uses the debootstrap
  second-stage technique described at
  http://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RootfsFromScratch/QemuDebootstrap to have
  processor-dependent part run by QEMU's user-mode tools, hence
  installing a system for a foreign processor.

* rinse: like debootstrap, but for Fedora, and not official. However
  it's currently not possible to build latest versions of the distro,
  it seems Fedora people prefer going through the installation process
  manually when they virtualize, and libvirt is going in that
  direction too :/

* Le Bouteur: Smallish standalone GRUB installation to boot on network
  or reinstall grub:

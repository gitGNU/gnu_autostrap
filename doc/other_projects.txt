* Le Bouteur: Smallish standalone GRUB installation to boot on network
  or reinstall grub:
  http://labs.libre-entreprise.org/projects/lebouteur/

* qemu-make-debian-root, part of the 'qemu' or 'qemu-utils' package
  under Debian

* qemubuilder: pbuilder runs qemu - it has to run, control and stop
  qemu, which is something we may need to do (e.g. generating a kernel
  initrd from within the emulator).

* rootstrap: also uses UML to build Debian-based systems

* rinse: like debootstrap, but for Fedora, and not official. However
  it's currently not possible to build latest versions of the distro,
  it seems Fedora people prefer going through the installation process
  manually when they virtualize, and libvirt is going in that
  direction too :/

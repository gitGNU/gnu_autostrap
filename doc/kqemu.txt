kqemu, QEMU's accelerator module for the Linux kernel, is not
supported at of v0.12 (2010).  Apparently there are issues with 64bit
support, and the development team is more interested in supporting KVM
(and enterprise virtualization).

The latest working version I tested is 0.11.1 + kqemu 0.14pre1.
A quick qemu compilation (that doesn't build all possible
architectures, just i386) can be done with::

  ./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu

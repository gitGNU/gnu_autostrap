          Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can
          be inserted in the running kernel, rather than being
          permanently built into the kernel.  You use the "modprobe"
          tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here,
          many parts of the kernel can be built as modules (by
          answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
          useful for infrequently used options which are not required
          for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for
          modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

          If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
          modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
          where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
          this).

          If unsure, say Y.

	---help---
	  This will include enhanced support for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks.  If
	  you have a MFM/RLL/IDE disk, and there is no special reason to use
	  the old hard disk driver instead, say Y.  If you have an SCSI-only
	  system, you can say N here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ide-disk.
	  Do not compile this driver as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on the IDE disk.

	  If unsure, say Y.
